Sustainable Websites Links Safari Toolbar
=========================================


This is a demonstration of Safari 5's new extensions capability. Specifically, Toolbars, and how easy it is to make one with CSS and HTML. 

The best way to explore this right now is to check out the source on github, download it, and load up the extension in Safari's Extension Builder (in the Develop menu)

I'm working on a forthcoming blog post on how I built this which will be posted on http://SustainableWebsites.com/blog
